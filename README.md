# check-schedule
## About
This website allows the user to input information in each of the time slots to keep track of the activities you need to do throughout the day. Simply type the information you want to be saved in your schedule, and once you are done typing, click the save button on the right. Even if the page is refreshed the information will be saved. 

To create this application I used:
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
